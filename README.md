#Movie Lab - Node

We'll be continuing our Movie app from this morning. At first, you created a 2 routes, one to search for a movie, and one to show movie search results.

The next steps in this app is create a movie detail page, and an ability to save a movie for a *Watch later list*.

##Requirements
1. User goes to home page that has a search form field for a movie.
2. The search form will take the user to a search results page of movie listings.
3. Each movie link should click into a view with detailed information about the movie.
4. On the movie detail page, have an option to save a movie for a watch later list.

##How to get Started
1. We left you off this morning showing the search results from the api provided at OMDBapi using a url like `http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=matrix`. The next step is to turn the movie results into links that will go to a new route, and make an additional API Request for additional movie details.

2. From the search results page, we notice along with every movie entry there is a IMDBid. Have each movie link to a route like `/movie/tt234323`. Take the parameter from that url and make an additional API call to retrieve movie details related to that `IMDBid`

3. The final part of this project is add some kind of "save" or "watch later" functionality. This can be in the form of a button or link. It should make a post request to a route that will store information about the movies you want to watch later. **Hint: Use an object or array to store this information**

4. Provide a watch later route, which list the movies you have saved. Each link should also take me back to a movie detail page using the above route.

##Bonus
* Style it up
* Have an option to remove the movie from the watch later list
* Try to incorporate Bootstrap, Foundation to utilize some of their components or css grids.
